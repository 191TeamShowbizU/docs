## What we are building

We are building a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) for ShowBizU. It will utilize a concept called “flipped learning,” which encourages students to learn on their own pace, with frequent communications with peers, instructors, and mentors. This service will offer quality in depth theater and film education to those who want it through structured courses with enriched content. It will help anyone who seeks learning theatre and film training to provide a way to tell a story to inspire others and provoke creative activity.

The primary resource in the MOOC that will help people get plugged into the learning environment of show business and receive mentorship is the Learning Paths activities. There will be a “Learning Path” for each subject that ShowBizU offers to teach, and different courses within that learning path. Each course will have engaging content to allow the learners to study the content, then practice it for themselves. For example, courses will have videos, PDF files, readings, images, and outside of the course assignments to complete. Other areas of the website that we are seeking to expand and develop involve the student, facilitator, and mentor accounts. 


## Why we are building it

This service will address an immediate problem in the market today: there are too few universities that offer quality theater education, and almost no online courses which teach it, especially in MOOC format. It will follow a similar structure of other MOOC platforms, like Khan Academy or Coursera, providing the same degree of accessibility to a specific audience of theater and film driven learners. In addition, this service may supplement an existing or ongoing education because of its accessibility and flexibility to time commitments. 

This service aims to target four types of audience personas. The first is called “Students”, which include young learners in either high school, college, or graduate school. The system would aid this group by exposing them to an efficient way of exploring their passions in a professional sense. The second group is named “Young Professionals”, which include recent college graduates that are initiating their professional careers. The system aims to allow them to explore their passion through formal education of necessary subjects. “Professionals” is the third group, which consist of existing professionals in the industry, either in film and theater or not. Since this online service will possibly offer varying levels of course difficulty for each type of audience, it will challenge and greatly benefit every user. The fourth audience persona type is “The Curious at Any Age”, which are all other individuals who have any interest in the website.

This system will encourage more students to study in theater, give graduates an easier place to start, and keep professionals updated. Our sponsors want to be the first place that people will look to when wanting to learn theater design, training, composing, and storytelling while providing a quality system of education.
