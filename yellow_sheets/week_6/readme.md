#Team ShowbizU

+STOP: Turning in things to the sponsor and the class the night before. Using the sponsor as an excuse as to why we cannot progress with the project.

+START: Working on deliverables earlier. Assign roles to assignments and a point person for each role (sponsor meeting leader, commiting to Github, etc.)

+IMPROVE: The way sponsor meetings are held. Designating who will get back to the sponsor for meeting recaps and doing it more quickly. Improving communication to be in a more timely manner.

+CONTINUE: Having meetings before and after sponsor meetings during the week. Communicating within the group if we are busy. Asking for clarification from the sponsor or each other.
