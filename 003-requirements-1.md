Unfortunately time ran out during our first meeting with the client and we were not able to talk explicitly about requirements.

## Assumptions

To function, the system will have:
+ an appeal to the intended users willing to access and engage in the content
+ databases to store user information and progress as well as course content
+ adequate servers to handle the traffic of users
+ regular maintenance to minimize downtime to maximize reliability

## Functional requirements

The product shall:

+ allow users to create accounts to access course content and track their progress
+ have a MOOC style learning path to educate the users 
+ provide users with a course page to view different courses by subject
+ streaming educational videos
+ feature to allow users to communicate and connect with each other

## Non-functional requirements

+ show up early in query searches using Search engine optimization
+ shall present itself in a MOOC style course hosting (similar to that of Khan academy or Coursera).
