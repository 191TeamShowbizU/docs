## File-management

We will use GitHub for file management.

All files will be put in GitHub repositories owned by our organization, "191TeamShowBizU".

All documentation will be stored in the "docs" repository.

We will also use Google Drive to draft early versions of documentation before committing to GitHub.

## Miscellaneous

We agree to communicate regularly, even if the news is bad.

Communication will be done through GroupMe, e-mail, and/or Facebook Group.

Every person commits to attending scheduled meetings and co-working hours.

We will tell our teammates as early as we can if we can't make a meeting or work session.

We agree to volunteer to take on tasks and do them well and on time as best we can.

If we don't know how to do something, we will do our best to figure it out. We will ask for help if we get stuck.

If there is a problem with the group or sponsor, we will discuss it openly.
