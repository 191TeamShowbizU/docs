* Research - Our research focus is on the community aspect of Social Media, MOOC, or any other type of forum website that is used to tell a “story”. Our team has began to research these websites already, but it is not complete because there are so many various websites of each genre. Gathering as much useful information about them, and comparing them to each other is taking longer than we had planned. Our sponsor is giving us until our next meeting, which is on Tuesday (05/06/14) to present to them what information we have gained through our research. Therefore, we will be continuing our research until then, and most likely after our next meeting with our sponsor.
