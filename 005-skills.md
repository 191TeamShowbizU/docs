## Individual Skills

- Okay

3.) How many times before have you used the language(s) and/or framework(s) you are using in this project? For each language or framework, pick one of “lots and lots,” “a couple times,” “once,” “never,” or “I never even heard of this thing.”

4.) To contribute fully to the project, what do you need to learn?

- I need to learn how to use Ruby and Rails.  I need to learn how to create and maintain a MOOC.

5.) In the next two weeks (weeks 4 and 5), how many hours will you spend learning what you need to learn to be able to contribute fully to the project?

- I will either be in my apartment or in a study room.

8.) How will you learn what you need to learn? Be as specific as possible. “I will work through Chapters 1–5 of Hello, Android” is much better than “I will do some tutorials about Android programming.”
