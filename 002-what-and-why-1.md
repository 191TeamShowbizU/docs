## What we are building

We are building a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) for ShowBizU. It will utilize a concept called “flipped learning,” which encourages students to learn on their own pace, with frequent communications with peers and instructors. This service will offer quality theater and film education to those who want it. It will help anyone who seeks learning theatre and film training to provide a way to tell a story. 

There will be many resources in the MOOC that will help people get plugged into a community, receive mentorship, and learn from a course series involving many different subjects. Areas of the website that we are seeking to expand and help develop are the Learning Paths Page, Courses Page, Video Homepage, and all “Community” sections. 

## Why we are building it

This service will address an immediate problem in the market today: there are too few universities that offer quality theater education, and almost no online courses which teach it, especially in MOOC format. It will follow a similar structure as “Khan Academy,” providing the same degree of accessibility to a theater oriented audience. In addition, this service may supplement an existing or ongoing education because of this format. 

This service aims to target three types of audiences. The first are young learners in high school, college, or graduate school to introduce them to the field. The second are recent college graduates that are initiating their professional careers. The third are existing professionals in the industry, either in film and theater or not. Since this online service will possibly offer varying levels of course difficulty for each type of audience, it will challenge and greatly benefit every user. 

This system will encourage more students to study in theater, give graduates an easier place to start, and keep professionals updated. Our sponsors want to be the first place that people will look to when wanting to learn theater design, training, composing, and storytelling while providing a quality system of education.
