What programming language(s) will you use?

- Ruby

What framework(s), if any, will you use?

- Rails

What other libraries or dependencies will you use?

- MySQL

Will you use different languages, frameworks, and/or libraries/dependencies for different parts of your application?
    
- Not as of right now

What is your overall architecture (e.g., MVC)?
    
- Model-view-controller

What data will you need to store?
    
- Course content (videos, text, images, etc.), user accounts, teacher accounts, facilitator accounts

What is your database design (or other data storage scheme)?
    
- We will use the database to store accounts in one section and content in another

What are the other parts of your software? For example, for an MVC app: What models will you make? What attributes and methods will they have? What controllers will you make? What methods will they have? What views will you make?

- The models will be the frameworks that hold the information to display (such as the database and the content). They will hold the account information and the content and have methods to push and pull information to the interface. The controllers we will make will be the user’s keyboard and mouse. They will be able to click through the course content in a linear fashion to go through and review it. The view will be displayed on the users screen as a structured web page with dynamic content.
